= Adding Dependencies for Usage Modes

{brandname} provides different dependencies for each usage mode. Add one of the following to your `pom.xml` file:

.Embedded Mode
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::dependencies_maven/sb_embedded.xml[]
----

.Remote Client/Server Mode
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::dependencies_maven/sb_remote.xml[]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {brandname} Spring Boot starter uses different Spring Boot versions to other projects such as Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes. If you want to use a specific Spring Boot version for compatibility with other projects, you must add the correct dependency to your project.
