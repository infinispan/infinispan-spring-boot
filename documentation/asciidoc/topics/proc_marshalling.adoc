= Marshalling changes

Latest version {brandname} comes with some important marshalling changes. ProtoStream marshaller is not the default marshaller.
This marshaller is not still fully supported for Spring integration. Support will be coming in the future releases.

https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/developing/developing.html#marshalling[More about {brandname} Marshalling]

For an existing Spring-Boot application, you need to specify two properties:

`infinispan.remote.marshaller=org.infinispan.commons.marshall.JavaSerializationMarshaller`
`infinispan.remote.java-serial-whitelist=your_marshalled_beans_package.*`
